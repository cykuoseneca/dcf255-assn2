    <h1>FTP History</h1>
    <p>
      The development of FTP has been gradual throughout time. The first File
      Transfer Protocol specification was authored by Abhay Bhushan and
      published on April 16, 1971, as RFC 114. Up until 1980, NCP, the
      predecessor of TCP/IP, supported FTP. Later, it was replaced by the
      TCP/IP version of the protocol, RFC 765 (June 1980), and the current
      standard, RFC 959 (October 1985). RFC 1579 (February 1994), which
      introduces Firewall-Friendly FTP (passive mode), RFC 2228 (June 1997),
      which calls for security improvements, and RFC 2428 (September 1998),
      which adds support for IPv6 and specifies a new type of passive mode,
      are just a few of the proposed measures that amend RFC 959.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest FTP specification intends to improve various protocol
      elements, introduce a few additional optional commands, and correct a
      few minor documentation errors. The following new optional commands are
      particularly included in this standard version: Structure Mount, Store
      Unique, Remove Directory, Make Directory, Print Directory, and System
      are all abbreviations for the letters SMNT, STOU, MKD, PWD, and SYST.
      Change to Parent Directory is the acronym for this. It is compatible
      with the older version of this standard. Software created by it should
      automatically satisfy the previous criterion.
