    <h1>FTP History</h1>
    <p>
      Over time, the growth of FTP has been gradual. Abhay Bhushan wrote the initial specification for the File Transfer
      Protocol, which was released as RFC 114 on April 16 of that year. FTP was supported by NCP, TCP/forerunner, IP's
      until 1980. Later, the TCP/IP version of the protocol, RFC 765 (June 1980), and the current standard, RFC 959,
      took its place (October 1985). These are just a few of the proposed changes that alter RFC 959, such as the
      addition of Firewall-Friendly FTP (passive mode) in RFC 1579 (February 1994), the request for security upgrades in
      RFC 2228 (June 1997), and the addition of support for IPv6 and a new type of passive mode in RFC 2428 (September
      1998) in RFC 2428.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest FTP specification intends to improve various protocol
      elements, introduce a few additional optional commands, and correct a
      few minor documentation errors. The following new optional commands are
      particularly included in this standard version: Structure Mount, Store
      Unique, Remove Directory, Make Directory, Print Directory, and System
      are all abbreviations for the letters SMNT, STOU, MKD, PWD, and SYST.
      Change to Parent Directory is the acronym for this. It is compatible
      with the older version of this standard. Software created by it should
      automatically satisfy the previous criterion.
