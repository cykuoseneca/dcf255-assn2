    <h1>FTP Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      File transfer protocol refers to the method used to transfer files via a
      network between devices (FTP). When one party agrees to let the other
      send or receive files online, the process is successful. File storage is
      now usually done in the cloud, which is frequently a remote safe region.
      It was initially used as a means of communication and information
      sharing between two physical machines.
    </p>

      FTP can be used by a company or individual to transmit data from one
      computer system to another, or by a website to upload or download files
      from its servers. FTP's objectives are:
    <ul>
      <li>Promoting file sharing</li>
      <li>Promoting the usage of remote computers in an implicit or indirect manner (via programs).</li>
      <li>Safeguard a user from variations in file storage methods between hosts.</li>
      <li>Transferring data in a reliable and efficient manner.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though it can be accessed by users via a terminal,
      FTP is primarily made to be used by programs.
      This specification seeks to meet the different requirements
      of users of maxi-hosts, mini-hosts, personal workstations,
      and TACs with an easy-to-implement protocol design.
