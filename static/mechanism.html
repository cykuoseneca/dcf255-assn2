    <h1>How File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Works</h1>
    <div>

      <h2>Operation Principle</h2>
      <p>
        The operating principle of FTP is relatively simple, with two
        connections between the server providing FTP services and the client
        connecting to the server. Port 21 is for transmitting and receiving
        signals for controlling data transmission, and port 20 is for
        transmitting an actual file. A network port refers to a path through
        which data travels through a network. Therefore, when the user accesses
        the FTP server, the information of the account or the file transfer
        command is performed on the data control connection (port 21), and the
        actual file transmission and reception are performed through the data
        transfer connection (port 20). Clients connected to the FTP server
        remain connected by sending constant messages to and from the FTP server
        for continuous transmission and reception of multiple files.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>

      <h2>Connection Modes</h2>
      <p>
        FTP supports two modes: passive mode and active mode in transferring
        data or files.
      </p>
      <h3>Active Mode</h3>
      <div>
        <a href="https://kikobeats.github.io/server-sandbox/assets/ftp-active.png" target="_blank">
          <img src="https://kikobeats.github.io/server-sandbox/assets/ftp-active.png" height="100%" width="40%"
            alt="FTP Active Mode" title="Click For Original Size" />
        </a>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="active-mode"><i><small>Fig 1. Active Mode</small></i></label>
        <p></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The client attempts to connect to port 21 of the FTP server and
          informs the server of the second port to be used. The server responds
          with ACK (acknowledge), and port 20 on the server attempts to connect
          to the second port that the client informed. Finally, the client
          responds with an ACK.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Passive Mode</h3>
      <div>
        <a href="https://kikobeats.github.io/server-sandbox/assets/ftp-passive.png" target="_blank">
          <img src="https://kikobeats.github.io/server-sandbox/assets/ftp-passive.png" height="100%" width="40%"
            alt="FTP Passive Mode" title="Click For Original Size" />
        </a>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="passive-mode"><i><small>Fig 2. Passive Mode</small></i></label>
        <p></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The passive mode was created to solve the problem of the active mode.
          In active mode, when a server attempts to connect to a client, the
          connection may fail or an error may occur due to a firewall or router
          on the client's PC. First, when the client attempts to access port 21,
          the server tells the server the second port to use. The client opens
          another port and attempts to connect to the port that the server has
          informed, and the server responds with an ACK. In passive mode, port
          20 is not used, but any port between 1024 and 65535.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Request and Response</h3>
        <p>
          The FTP protocol is a text-based protocol that uses request and
          response structures similar to other Internet protocols such as HTTP
          and SMTP.
        </p>
        <p>It defines this protocol by first identifying the default request and response flows. The client opens a TCP
          connection to the FTP server to start a typical FTP session. The FTP server normally recognizes the server and
          offers the client a connection greeting letting them know they can keep sending commands. The protocol then
          consists of a series of requests made by the client and answers given by the server.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>File Operation</h2>
      <p>FTP operations can be divided into three categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>File download from FTP Server to FTP Client</b>: Also known as obtaining a file, file download from an
          FTP server to an FTP client. Use the
          <b>RETR</b> command to retrieve the file internally.
        </li>
        <li><b>File upload from FTP Client to FTP Server</b>: Also known as file storage is the process of uploading
          files from an FTP client to an FTP server.
          <b>STOR</b> commands are employed internally to store files.
        </li>
        <li><b>Remote Directory Listing</b>: Listing of the contents of a remote directory in a remote directory. The
          remote directory's contents are listed internally using the
          <b>LIST</b> command.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Data Connection</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>File Structure</h2>
        <p>The file transfer structure is specified using the FTP STRU command. A alternate file structure is as
          follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>F (FILE structure)</b>: A stream of bytes that never ends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>R (RECORD structure)</b>: A file with records of a fixed or variable length separating the files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>P (PAGE structure)</b>: Files are organized by page, with a page number and a page header on each page.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Data transfer modes</h2>
        <p>The following are various FTP transfer modes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Stream mode</b>: n this mode, data is transmitted as an unbroken stream of bytes. Over a TCP data
            connection, the transmitter begins transmitting data to the recipient. Contrary to many other protocols,
            which transfer data in distinct chunks, message formats with independent header fields are not employed. It
            heavily depends on the dependable transport services and data streaming provided by TCP. The end of the file
            is displayed when the transfer device cuts off the data connection because there is no header structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Block mode</b>: This more "conventional" data transfer option divides data into blocks and encapsulates
            each block or record into an independent FTP block. The length of each record is indicated via a three-byte
            header that also includes details about the data blocks being transmitted. Data transmissions are tracked,
            detected, and restarted using specialized algorithms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compression mode</b>: Transmission mode employs a relatively straightforward compression method called
            run-length encoding to identify recurring transmission patterns and reduce the overall message's byte count.
            Similar to block mode, compressed data is delivered using a header + payload record structure.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Data transfer types</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>TYPE A</b>: ASCII, the default format for transferring text files
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>TYPE E</b>: EBCDIC
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>TYPE I</b>: Image, the default format for transferring binary files
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>TYPE N</b>: Nonprintable text files
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>TYPE T</b>: TELNET
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Message Syntax</h1>
        <p>The data needed by various FTP messages is encoded in the FTP payload. For multi-message data transmission,
          these contain fields for recording commands that are being transmitted, the sequence number of the current FTP
          message, and the amount of data in the message's data section.
        </p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>FTP is not built for security. FTP was designed for networks from the 1960s to the 1980s. Computer networks
        during the period were considered secure. But before you know it, FTP is considered an unsafe protocol because
        it sends user authentication and file data over the network in plain text. This makes FTP vulnerable to password
        sniffing, data spoofing, and other network attacks.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, FTP is still used because it works simply, is intuitive, and is simple to use. Above all, FTP's
        biggest advantage is that it can send and receive files at once faster than WWW methods. In the case of WWW,
        general characters, photos, and video content are easily used, but they are slow to send and receive large
        amounts of files and are difficult to control files.</p>
